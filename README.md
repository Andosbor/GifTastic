I was able to grab data from an outside source (giphy.com) and apply that data to my creation. I learned how to let the user create a button titled whatever he wants, click that button, and return results related to that button's title. The activities that were covered in class helped a lot for this assignment. Although there were a couple points where my code wasn't working correctly, trying different things to fix it proved successful.
